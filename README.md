Typing in a Turkish using a US keyboard can be tricky because Turkish alphabets contain diacritic letters that are not on the US keyboard layout. Using Turkish keyboard extension solves this problem, however one difficulty I found is that it changes the overall layout of the keyboard and now you have to manually find out which one is which. So I wrote a simple script that allows you to type diacritic letters by quickly pressing the same key twice. For example, quickly pressing on "u" twice will type "ü".

Transformation chart:<br>
İ, i -> I, ı<br>
O, o -> Ö, ö<br>
U, u -> Ü, ü<br>
C, c -> Ç, ç<br>
S, s -> Ş, ş<br>
G, g -> Ğ, ğ<br>

**This is probably not perfect and I expect there will be some glitches.**

**Install Guide:**
Download `turkish_double.exe`.

If you see a blue screen that says Windows Smart Defender SmartScreen, click on **More info** and click **Run anyway**. Next time, you can simply double-click on the downloaded `turkish_double.exe` to start the program.

To close the program, go to the right corner of your taskbar, and click on **show hidden icons** that look like ^. There should be a green H icon. Right-click on it, then click on **Exit**.
