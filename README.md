Typing in Turkish using a US keyboard can be tricky because Turkish alphabets contain diacritic letters that are not on the US keyboard layout. Using Turkish keyboard extension solves this problem, however one difficulty I found is that it changes the overall layout of the keyboard and now you have to manually find out which one is which. So I wrote a simple script that allows you to type diacritic letters by quickly pressing the same key twice. For example, quickly pressing on "u" twice will type "ü".

Transformation chart:<br>
U, u -> Ü, ü<br>
O, o -> Ö, ö<br>
İ, i -> I, ı<br>
C, c -> Ç, ç<br>
S, s -> Ş, ş<br>
G, g -> Ğ, ğ<br>

**This is probably not perfect and I expect there will be some glitches.**

**Note:**<br>
I release my script under the the public domain license which means you are free to do whatever you wish with it. So feel free to change and share.

However, [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) v1.1 which my script is complied by is a free/open-source software licensed under [GNU GPLv2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html). GPLv2 allows you to freely use, study, modify the program, and distribute the original and the modified version as you wish. But in extra, GPLv2 also requires that any software that uses a GPL software must contain the source code. Therefore `turkish_double.exe` file that was complied by AutoHotKey is also under GPLv2. So when you are sharing `turkish_double.exe` file to someone, please let them know that the original source code is available here on this page. When you are sharing `turkish_double.ahk` file, you don't have to do anything because AHK file is just a simple text file which does not contain any of AutoHotKey.

Summary: When you are sharing `turkish_double.exe` to someone, just let them know that the original source code is available here on this page (https://github.com/Sonnykimee/TurkishTyper). Thank you!
